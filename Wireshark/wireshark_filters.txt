Resolve IP addresses:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://osqa-ask.wireshark.org/questions/37680/can-wireshark-automatically-resolve-the-ip-address-into-host-names

Edit -> Preferences -> Name Resolution

You can also 'Use an external name resolver' to resolve the IP addresses using your DNS when you open the trace file.


Sort by conversations:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://osqa-ask.wireshark.org/questions/4164/building-display-filter-using-conversations

Simplify your filter to "tcp.flags == 0x02". This will show you the initial SYN of each conversation. (TCP 3-way Handshake. SYN,SYN-ACK,ACK)

tcp.flags == 0x02


Logical expressions:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark-filter.html

Tests can be combined using logical expressions. These too are expressible in C-like syntax or with English-like abbreviations:
    and, &&   Logical AND
    or,  ||   Logical OR
    not, !    Logical NOT

Expressions can be grouped by parentheses as well. The following are all valid display filter expressions:
    tcp.port == 80 and ip.src == 192.168.2.1
    not llc
    http and frame[100-199] contains "wireshark"
    (ipx.src.net == 0xbad && ipx.src.node == 0.0.0.0.0.1) || ip



Filter certain conversations:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/news/8-wireshark-filters-every-wiretapper-uses-spy-web-conversations-and-surfing-habits-0134508/

ip.addr ==x.x.x.x && ip.addr ==x.x.x.x

Sets a conversation filter between the two IP addresses.


https://thetechl33t.com/2015/06/01/wireshark-not-equal-to-filter/

To filter out a certain IP address, the !- statment is deprecated. Instead use this:

!ip.addr == 192.168.0.1

To filter out multiple IP addresses, use:

!ip.addr == 192.168.0.1 && !ip.addr == pi.hole
!ip.addr == 192.168.0.1 && !ip.host == pi.hole


https://osqa-ask.wireshark.org/questions/22230/filter-for-partial-ip-address

To filter for public hostnames, use:

ip.host contains netflix
ip.host contains netflix || ip.host contains nflxext.com

15. Filter on three way handshake

The three way handshake is often used to calculate the network round trip time. This filter will display all the SYN, SYN ACK and SYN packets that should match the three way handshake.

tcp.flags.syn==1 or (tcp.seq==1 and tcp.ack==1 and tcp.len==0 and tcp.analysis.initial_rtt)

16. Find executable or other file types

Need to  see if users are download .exe or other file types use this filter:

frame contains "(attachment|tar|exe|zip|pdf)"

Just add in any other file extension you want to filter for.

17. Search traffic based on a keyword:

tcp contains facebook

This displays all TCP packets that contain the word facebook. Just replace the word with want you want to search for. The only problem with this filter is itâ€™s limited to TCP packets only. To include all protocols use this filter:

frame contains facebook

Case Sensitivity:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark-filter.html

    contains     Does the protocol, field or slice contain a value
    matches, ~   Does the protocol or text string match the given
                 case-insensitive Perl-compatible regular expression

Matches are case-insensitive by default. For example, to search for a given WAP WSP User-Agent, you can write:

    wsp.user_agent matches "cldc"

This would match "cldc", "CLDC", "cLdC" or any other combination of upper and lower case letters.



Wireshark can only decrypt RSA, and only if the private key is known:
